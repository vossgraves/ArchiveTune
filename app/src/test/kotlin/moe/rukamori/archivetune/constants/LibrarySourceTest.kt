/**
 * Guards the rule every Library screen now reads its source through.
 *
 * The Library hands its sections one resolved source, so this decides what all of them read at
 * once. Spotify resolves to YTM while no session is signed in and switched on, which is what keeps
 * the mixes, playlists and artists rails off an account that is not there — the empty states they
 * fall back to only mean something if the source they were handed can be read at all. YTM is never
 * affected: it has no session to be missing.
