/**
 * How the user's video-quality choice is encoded.
 *
 * The choice travels as a nullable `Int` — through [LocalVideoPreferredHeight], the
 * `preferredHeight` parameter of [rememberVideoArtworkStateOrNull], and Player.kt's
 * `rememberSaveable` holder. Keeping it a primitive is deliberate: `rememberSaveable` can persist
 * an `Int?` across configuration changes and process death with no custom `Saver`, which an enum
 * or sealed type would need.
 *
 * The encoding is therefore:
 *  - `null`            → **Auto**: best resolution the device decodes comfortably, capped at
 *                        [AUTO_HEIGHT_CEILING].
 *  - [DATA_SAVER]      → cap at [DATA_SAVER_HEIGHT_CEILING].
 *  - [HIGH_QUALITY]    → highest resolution YouTube offers, up to whatever this device can
 *                        actually decode ([VideoDecoderCapabilities.maxSupportedHeight]). This is
 *                        the path to 4K/8K "original quality".
 *  - any positive int  → an exact height picked from the Advanced list (e.g. `2160`).
 *
 * The two mode sentinels are negative so they can never collide with a real height.

     * enough per-frame time that the video falls behind the separately-loaded audio track and
     * trips the resync watchdog in [VideoArtworkState] — the exact reason the old hard-coded
     * 1080p cap existed. Auto is the default, so it keeps the conservative behaviour; a user who
     * wants the original resolution asks for it explicitly via High quality or Advanced, and then
     * the only remaining ceiling is what the decoder reports.
