/**
 * Resolves the looping animated canvas a playlist page plays behind its header.
 *
 * A playlist has no artwork of its own to look a canvas up by, so the first song stands in for it —
 * the same trade the album page makes with its first track.
 *
 * The loop piggybacks on the album page's switch ([AlbumCanvasEnabledKey], whose settings row reads
 * "Enable canvas in albums page") rather than getting a preference of its own: a playlist page
 * offers no separate choice, so a user who has turned canvases off in albums has turned them off
 * here too. What it does not share with the player is the timing — the loop starts as soon as the
 * page opens, whether or not anything is playing, which is why the fetch sits in the playlist
 * ViewModels rather than in the player's artwork pipeline.
 *
 * Only the Online and Top playlist pages ask for it: the two that pass the artwork to
 * `MediaDetailHero`, which loops it unless the Apple Music Experience is on — that branch swaps in
 * `AppleMusicPlaylistHero`, which has no backdrop for a canvas to sit behind. The other four
 * playlist pages pass no canvas and show static artwork.
