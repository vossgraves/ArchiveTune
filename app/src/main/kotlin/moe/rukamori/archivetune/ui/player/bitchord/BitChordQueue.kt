/*
 * Bitchord player style — the inline queue.
 *
 * Ported from BitChord (https://github.com/kushagrasinghx/BitChord), the
 * InlineQueue / QueueDragState / InlineQueueRow / edgeScrollSpeed /
 * stableQueueKeys sections of ui/player/NowPlayingScreen.kt.
 *
 * Adaptations for ArchiveTune (documented inline):
 *  - BitChord's `Song` model is replaced by a lightweight [BitChordQueueSong]
 *    mapped from ArchiveTune's ExoPlayer timeline windows.
 *  - BitChord's AutoPlay queue section (fromAutoplay / autoplaySectionStart)
 *    is omitted: ArchiveTune has no autoplay engine, so the queue is a single
 *    section with the same rows, drag-to-reorder, edge auto-scroll and Clear.
 *
 * Belongs exclusively to the Bitchord player style; not shared with any other
 * player style, per the self-containment rule for player styles (2026-09-01).
