/**

 * move identically.
 *
 * The anchor drifts between random targets spread over the WHOLE reachable disc — never a narrow
 * ring around the centre — so the colour mass explores every part of the screen: it can sink into
 * the lower half, travel past the top edge and sweep back in. Each leg is cosine-eased, so velocity
 * is zero at every waypoint and a direction change never flickers or snaps. [blurBackdropFootprint]
 * sizes the backdrop so it keeps covering the display at any offset, which is what makes the motion
 * gapless.

 * identically everywhere: the anchor may reach ~85% of the half-diagonal away from the centre in
 * any direction, letting colour features traverse the whole display and briefly cross its bounds
 * before the (always-covering) backdrop sweeps them back in.
 *
 * The amplitude is what the backdrop layer has to grow to cover (see [blurBackdropFootprint]), so it
 * is a real GPU-memory cost. The standalone lyrics screen is the one that pays it: there the rest
 * scale and the drift scale are both 2.4, so the covering footprint of its 64dp-blurred offscreen
 * layer goes from ~527dp to ~787dp on a 411x914dp screen — an extra ~260dp square of ARGB_8888
 * raster, on the order of 10MB. The Apple Music player and SpatialFlow keep their previous footprint
 * because their resting scale term dominates that maths instead. Capping the amplitude (for example
 * min(half-diagonal * 0.85, 240dp)) would buy the memory back, but it would also shorten the wander
 * visibly on every normal phone, so the cost stands unless a low-RAM device shows jank here.
