/**
 * A single soft highlight travelling the length of the bar, over and over,
 * while two tracks are being mixed.
 *
 * Drawn as a moving gradient rather than an opacity pulse because a pulse reads
 * as "loading" — the thing every shimmer in every app means — and this is the
 * opposite claim: not that the app is waiting, but that it is doing something.
 * Motion along the bar also points the same way the music is going.
 *
 * Sweeps the **whole** bar rather than the played portion, which the first
 * version did and which made it invisible twice over. A transition happens in
 * the opening seconds of the incoming track, so the played portion is then a
 * few percent of the width — a highlight travelling across that is a flicker at
 * the far left. And the played portion is already white at 0.92 alpha, so white
 * at 0.55 over it resolves to 0.96: the same hue, four percent brighter. The
 * unplayed track sits at 0.26, and that is where a white band actually reads.
