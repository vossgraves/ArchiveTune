/*
 * Bitchord player style — lyrics model + lyrics panel.
 *
 * Ported from BitChord (https://github.com/kushagrasinghx/BitChord):
 *  - data/lyrics/LyricLine.kt (model, verbatim)
 *  - the lyric composables from ui/player/NowPlayingScreen.kt
 *    (rememberLyricClock, SweptLyricLine, glowAt, sweepTo, CurrentLyricLine,
 *    LyricsUnavailableLine, LyricsLoadingLine, keepScrollInList,
 *    bleedHorizontally, fadingEdges)
 *
 * The full-screen LyricsPanel that used to live here is gone: the lyrics window now opens the
 * app's own LyricsV2 / LyricsEnhanced, so the style follows the Lyrics settings like every other
 * surface. What remains is the one-line strip on the collapsed player, which has no list around
 * it and is what BitChord's character sweep was actually for.
 *
 * Adaptations for ArchiveTune (documented inline):
 *  - a mapper from ArchiveTune's parsed lyrics ([LyricsEntry] with
 *    [WordTimestamp] word timings, seconds) into BitChord's [LyricLine]
 *    (milliseconds), including the background-vocal split.
 *  - `rememberIsForeground` (BitChord) is replaced by a Lifecycle RESUMED
 *    observation, same semantics.
 *  - AppSettings reads (reduceAnimation / reduceDynamicBlur) replaced with
 *    parameters/LocalAnimationsDisabled.
 *  - BitChord's per-lyric lyric-clock follows the player position; the entry
 *    composable passes position + isPlaying in.
 *
 * Belongs exclusively to the Bitchord player style; not shared with any other
 * player style, per the self-containment rule for player styles (2026-09-01).
