 * Surface colours for screens that can render over the Liquid Glass backdrop.
 *
 * Adapted from YumaPlayer's GlassScaffold (MuwMx/YumaPlayer, GPL-3.0, a fork of this app), with
 * the one change that matters here: that version is transparent unconditionally, so every screen
 * is glass and there is no Material 3 look left. These helpers are transparent ONLY while the
 * Liquid Glass preference is on and return the ordinary Material 3 surface otherwise — Material 3
 * stays the default and glass is the opt-in, which is the inverse of the fork's choice.
 *
 * Deliberately colour helpers rather than a Scaffold wrapper: every settings screen already builds
 * its own Scaffold with its own insets, top bar and scroll behaviour, so a wrapper would force each
 * one to be restructured to adopt glass. Two one-line substitutions per screen do the same job.

 *
 * Which of the two applies is read off the surface's own luminance rather than
 * `isSystemInDarkTheme()`: the app's dark mode is a preference with an AUTO/ON/OFF setting plus a
 * pure-black variant, so forcing dark on a light system would otherwise paint the light tint over
