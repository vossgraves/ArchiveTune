/**
 * The editorial side of a track — description, uploader, subscriber and view counts.
 *
 * Two copies of this fetch existed: one inside [ShowMediaInfo], so the only way to read a song's
 * description was to open that bottom sheet, and one inside the SimpMusic player for its
 * below-the-fold cards. They had already drifted — SimpMusic checked the id shape first and the
 * sheet did not, so on a Tidal, Qobuz, Spotify or local track the sheet spent a network round trip
 * to be told the id means nothing to YouTube. The gate is kept and both surfaces now share it.
 *
 * Null while loading, on failure, and for an id this cannot serve. No caller has a useful
 * distinction to draw between "not yet" and "never" — a card with nothing to say hides either way.
