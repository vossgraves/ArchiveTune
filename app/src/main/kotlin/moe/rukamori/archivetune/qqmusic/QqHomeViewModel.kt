 *
 * The page belongs to the signed-in account, so its sections are fetched once per account rather
 * than on every visit — leaving the Home tab and coming back does not re-fetch, and using the page
 * while signed in as somebody else does not show the previous account's charts. Only a refresh asks
 * QQ again.
 *
 * Every way this page can fail is a state rather than a throw: a feed that comes back useless is
 * the empty state, a feed that could not be fetched is an error carrying the reason it could not be
 * shown, and neither is something the screen has to guard against.
