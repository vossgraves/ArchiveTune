 *
 * Playing a track from the signed-in user's own QQ Music account.
 *
 * The shape is the same as every other source here: the playback layer hands over the metadata it
 * knows, this turns it into a playable stream, and the shared
 * [moe.rukamori.archivetune.audiosource.TitleMatch] gate decides whether what came back really is
 * the right track. What is unusual is that QQ Music is addressed by resource name rather than by
 * track, so the work is: find the catalogue entry, learn its resource id, ask for that resource at
 * the quality the user chose, and — only when the service answers with a protected container rather
 * than a plain file — decrypt it on device.
 *
 * The account is the one the user signed in with. Nothing here reaches for another account's
 * entitlements, borrows a credential, or asks for a tier the account does not have: an unentitled
 * tier comes back empty from the service and this returns null so the resolver carries on down the
 * chain, which is how every other source behaves.
 *
 * Failure is always null. A missing session, an empty catalogue result, a rejected metadata match,
 * an unentitled quality, a container whose key cannot be recovered — all of them mean "not this
 * source, try the next", never a partial stream.
