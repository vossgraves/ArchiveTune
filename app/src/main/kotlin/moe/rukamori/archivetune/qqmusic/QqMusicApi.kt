 *
 * The QQ Music RPC surface this source needs: catalogue search, track detail, the Home page's
 * charts, and the call that mints a playable URL for the signed-in account.
 *
 * Every call is a single POST to `https://u.y.qq.com/cgi-bin/musicu.fcg` carrying a
 * `{comm, req_N: {module, method, param}}` envelope. `comm` identifies the caller; the module name
 * identifies the operation. This is the protocol QQ Music's own clients speak, not a published
 * API: Tencent's OpenAPI is enterprise-only, so a personal account is reached the same way the
 * official desktop and web clients reach it, with the account's own credentials.
 *
 * The url-minter is a `filename`-based call: the client does not name a track, it names the
 * *resource* — `<prefix><media_mid><extension>` — and gets back a relative path plus a CDN list.
 * The prefix selects the quality tier, so the tier the user picks in settings is what gets asked
 * for, and a tier the account is not entitled to comes back empty rather than being worked around.
 *
 * No request signature is needed here. The `sign=` parameter belongs to the separate `musics.fcg`
 * endpoint, whose signer is a JavaScript virtual machine; `musicu.fcg` authenticates with the
 * account ticket alone. What it does need is `g_tk`, which is derived from that ticket below.
