 * Media3 DataSource that streams a Telegram file through TDLib's partial-download cache.
 * open() kicks off (or re-targets) a download at the requested byte offset; read() serves bytes
 * out of the already-downloaded prefix via ReadFilePart, waiting for the download to catch up
 * when the player reads faster than the network. Seeking simply re-opens the source at the new
 * position, which TDLib translates into a new download offset — so FLAC seeking works without
 * waiting for the whole file.
 *
 * TDLib keeps the partial file in its own cache, so pause/resume and replays don't re-download.

     * fetching at that same point and only resumed when the buffer drained enough for
     * the player to reopen. The downloaded prefix therefore tracked playback at a fixed

     * own bitrate for its entire duration — and any sustained dip in throughput (which,
     * for a large file on Telegram, is most likely *late* in the transfer) drained the
     * buffer and stalled playback. That is the "plays fine for the first few minutes,
     * buffers near the end" report.
     *
     * Leaving the download running lets TDLib finish the file well before playback
     * reaches the end, after which reads are served from local disk and cannot stall.
     * The number of concurrently retained files is bounded by [retainDownload], and the
     * bytes land in TDLib's own cache — the same place a completed listen would have
     * put them — so pause/resume and replays still cost nothing.
